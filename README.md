# LinuxSetup
### My personal script for setting up new Ubuntu installs.
### Designed to work on Ubuntu 18.04.

Start by downloading the repository as a .zip using the green "Clone or download" on the top right.

Extract the zipped contents. Open a terminal and navigate into the LinuxSetup folder.

Set setupScript.sh as executable with the command:

`chmod +x setupScript.sh`

Then to run the script, use the command:

`sudo ./setupScript.sh`
