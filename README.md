# LinuxSetup
### My personal script for setting up new Ubuntu installs.
### Designed to work on regular Ubuntu 20.04.

Start by downloading the repository as a .zip using the green "Clone or download" on the top right.

Extract the zipped contents. Open a terminal and navigate into the LinuxSetup folder.

Set script1.sh and script2.sh as executable with the command:

`chmod +x script1.sh && chmod +x script2.sh`

Then to run the first script, use the command:

`sudo ./script1.sh`

After the reboot,

Navigate back to the LinuxSetup folder, and then run the second script, with the command:

`sudo ./script2.sh`
