# LinuxSetup
### My personal script for setting up new Ubuntu installs.
### Designed to work on Ubuntu 20.04.

## This repository has been archived on GitHub and moved to GitLab. Please see the project on GitLab.com: https://gitlab.com/ABotelho23/LinuxSetup

Start by downloading the repository as a .zip using the green "Clone or download" on the top right.

Extract the zipped contents. Open a terminal and navigate into the LinuxSetup folder.

Set setup.sh as executable with the command:

`chmod +x setup.sh`

Then to run the script, use the command:

`sudo ./setup.sh`

The script will have a few prompts at the beginning, and then at the end. It will finally prompt to reboot, which I recommend.
